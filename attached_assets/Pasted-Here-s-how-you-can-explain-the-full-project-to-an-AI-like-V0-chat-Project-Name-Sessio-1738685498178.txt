   - Session stores ongoing discussions between farmers and buyers.  

5️⃣ *AI-Powered Chatbot (Rasa/Dialogflow)*  
   - Understands queries like "Show me vegetables under ₹50/kg".  
   - Provides *product recommendations & transaction support*.  

6️⃣ *Security & Session Handling*  
   - *JWT-based authentication* to protect user data.

### *🔹 Expected User Flow*
📌 *Farmer Journey:*  
1️⃣ Farmer logs in and adds a product (e.g., Tomatoes @ ₹30/kg).  
2️⃣ Product appears in the chatbot’s searchable database.  
3️⃣ Farmer receives *buyer requests* & negotiates prices in chat.  
4️⃣ Farmer confirms the *finalized order* in the chatbot session.  

📌 *Buyer Journey:*  
1️⃣ Buyer logs in and searches for products (e.g., "Tomatoes under ₹50/kg").  
2️⃣ Chatbot displays available products with prices & farmer details.  
3️⃣ Buyer starts a *negotiation session* for bulk ordering.  
4️⃣ Final price is agreed upon, and the *order is placed*.

### *🔹 Next Steps for Development*
✅ *Phase 1: Backend API (FastAPI + SQLite)*  
✅ *Phase 2: Session Handling (Redis + JWT Authentication)*  
✅ *Phase 3: Chatbot Implementation (Rasa/Dialogflow)*  
✅ *Phase 4: Frontend or WhatsApp Integration*  
✅ *Phase 5: Deployment & Testing*
